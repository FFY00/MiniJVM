+ miniJVM is a little gui app that lets you edit your Java bytecode in a more friendly and typesafe way than in Notepad.
+ It also lets you step through your bytecode, debugger style, and see what is being pushed/popped off the stack.
+ Great for learning bytecode!

## To build and run miniJVM do this:

 - Clone the repository
 - Run 'mvn clean build'

###### Maintained by FFY00 (Anubis)
